	<h3>Starting Your Research</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Visual Design</li>
				<p>The website is objectively fine but simple for today's standard for a website. It does have a cool aethethic and great use of being simple, it doesn't overwhelm the user.</p>
			<li>Content</li>
				<p>Information on this website is clear and simple. What you need from a restaurant is there. It could be structured with more information but any nessecary information is there. The manner is which the content is layed out feels intentional focusing on giving the user basic information of hours, how to order, and menu. How the content is laid out feels like it was made with mobile/tablet in mind because the content is all in the middle.</p>
			<li>"Call to Action" on Home Page</li>
				<p>Because of the pandemic and people not eating out as much a call to action to order your via delivery is emphasized with options on how to order your food. There is an option to view the menu and their instagram.</p>
			<li>Navigation</li>
				<p>Website is easy to navigate. There is no confusion to order food, look up the location. There is only 2-3 pages but that looks intentional.</p>
			<li>Functionality</li>
				<p>Website works really well, no dead pages but considering how little space they've used they could probably consider using it more across the page rather than all vertically </p>
			<li>Community Building</li>
				<p>They do have an instagram and it is very active with social events. They should consider other platforms but as is they are very active.</p>
		</ul>
	<h3>Goals and Target Audiance</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>What Questions need to be answered in order to complete this project?</li>
				<p>Does it need to be redesigned? What needs to change? Is there something that the restaurant isn't promoting as much as they should? What can be used to deferentiate from other restaurant websites? </p>
			<li>What tasks do we need to complete in order successfully design this website?</li>
				<p>What the needs of the company and user are</p>
				<p>research</li>
				<p>analyze what's best moving foward</p>
				<p>design lo-fi to hi-fi prototypes</p>
				<p>User test and feedback</p>
				<p>adjust to feedback</p>
				<br>
			<li>What issues need to be solved?</p>
				<p>Using their space more evenly across the page</p>
				<p>Promote their social media</p>
				<p>Add more information what users would want to know because as is there is nothing wrong but with the amount of information displayed more content could be plavced on the home page.</p>
			<li>What is our schedule</li>
			<p>About 4 months</p>
		</ul>
	<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
		<ul>

			<h4>Goldburger</h4>
				<li>Visual Design</li>
					<p>Website looks beautiful from the logo and the photos they use to display their amazing looking burgers but their section to display their location looks a little empty some sections could be subjectively judged with their spacing but nothing wrong, all pages follow the same pattern style</p>
				<li>Content</li>
					<p>Content is clear and spread out. Easy to digest, placement could be better to take advantage of on a desktop monitor some areas are layed out towards one side of the page while others towards the middle</p>
				<li>"Call to Action" on Home Page</li>
					<p>Call to action options are easy to find, there is no confusion but the order online section does have two order online options one as a title and one to actually order online. </p>
				<li>Navigation</li>
					<p>navigating through the website is simple and there is no dead links</p>
				<li>Functionality</li>
					<p>Website works really well, users will have very little trouble ordering food or completing their objective.  </p>
				<li>Community Building</li>
					<p>Goldburgers post frequently on Instagram but not as much on other platforms, this could be an engagement reason but using other platforms is worth the trouble </p>

			<h4>Burgerlords</h4>
				<li>Visual Design</li>
					<p>BurgerLords has a very hip design to it. Their images are almost polaroid in effect. They should use higher quality images for some of their icons. It really gives the aesthetic that photography is a focal point for them. They give the aesthtic of being your local burger joint.  </p>
				<li>Content</li>
					<p>The content is laid out with the menu on the left with the rest of the page information next to it. It's designed for tablet and mobile in mind and could take advantage of a desktop monitor especially since photos are an interest for the company. The website could take advantage and use the amount of space a monitor could have without overwhelming the user. </p>
				<li>"Call to Action" on Home Page</li>
					<p>Because of how easy it is to read the page it's easy to order food some sections like goldbelly or leftover could be confusing if the user
					doesn't know what that is but it does spark enough interest to click on them. Goldbelly being an online option to order food that is dried freeze and shipped could confuse the person as it is ordering food and there is a order food option already. </p>
				<li>Navigation</li>
					<p>navigating through the website is simple as there is little options. They do have a leftovers tab that at first I thought was like a food drive donation option but it's information like a loyalty program, press, and a mailing list. It could probably change that to not confuse the user maybe a secondary menu on desktop because on mobile it is a secondary menu.</p>
				<li>Functionality</li>
					<p>Burgerlords works well, the site looks like it was designed for a tablet/mobile but to order food it is well made.   </p>
				<li>Community Building</li>
					<p>Burgerlords does a well job of promoting that they are a vegan establishment. They do promote a healthy amount on their instagram but not so much on twitter but they do have a lot of post on tumblr which seems to be a more niche platform as they post art there.</p>

			<h4>Monty's Good Burger</h4>
				<li>Visual Design</li>
					<p>This is a really cool website. They really tried giving it a cool pattern scheme and you could really tell that they are going for that 1950s-60s diner look. They have a lot of custom art that has its own style and mascot that really gives it association.  </p>
				<li>Content</li>
					<p>The content is really well put and it has great use of real estate through out the pages. probably their location section could be adjusted to fit evenly </p>
				<li>"Call to Action" on Home Page</li>
					<p>Their order now and menu option is basically the same thing it sends your to the order section which makes sense and probably makes it easier for people who have either train of though when navigating  </p>
				<li>Navigation</li>
					<p>The majority of the information you would probably want to know is on the home page if you scroll far enough any other page a user will want to go through is on the menu</p>
				<li>Functionality</li>
					<p>Monty's website is easy to nagivate. information is easy to digest and on the home page. it takes advantage of a desktop monitor with information without overwhemling the user.   </p>
				<li>Community Building</li>
					<p>Monty's promotes being a plant based restaurant which is really cool, they promote the benefits of switching to a plant based diet. They are active on the platforms that they do have social media which is great.</p>	

			<h4>Stout Burgers & Beer</h4>
				<li>Visual Design</li>
					<p>This website is well made and reminds me of a franchise chain like BJ's or Chilis but with more of a bar theme to it than a family dinner location. It really emphasizes its food with photos in the front page and that's a good thing because the food looks delicious </p>
				<li>Content</li>
					<p>The content is well designed and takes real estate well. The press section could be adjusted better across the screen </p>
				<li>"Call to Action" on Home Page</li>
					<p>The call to action for delivery is emphasized especially during a pandemic when people aren't eating out as often they have made it a point that delivery is an option </p>
				<li>Navigation</li>
					<p>The website is easy to navigate it could probably combine it's event section.</p>
				<li>Functionality</li>
					<p>The majority of information that people would want is on the front page. there is little to no confusion for people navigating through the site's pages  </p>
				<li>Community Building</li>
					<p>Stout really promotes on their social media maybe because it's a chain and has the resourced.</p>
